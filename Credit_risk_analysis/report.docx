Credit Risk Analysis - Logistic Regression
Objective:
The objective of this project was to develop a model for credit risk analysis, 
specifically to predict whether a customer will default on a loan based on their financial characteristics. 
The target variable is the binary indicator of whether the customer defaults (default), where 1 represents a default 
and 0 represents no default.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains the following columns:

age: Age of the customer
ed: Education level of the customer
employ: Employment duration (in years)
address: Number of years at current address
income: Income of the customer
debtinc: Debt-to-income ratio
creddebt: Credit debt of the customer
othdebt: Other debt of the customer
default: Target variable indicating whether the customer defaulted (1) or not (0)
Data Preprocessing:
Missing Values:

The default column had 450 missing values, which were filled with 0 (assuming no default for those rows).
There were no other missing values in the dataset.
Descriptive Statistics:

Age ranges from 20 to 56 years with a mean of 35.24 years.
The income variable has a wide range, with a minimum of 13 and a maximum of 446.
Debt-to-income ratio ranges from 0.1% to 41.3%.
Outlier Detection:

Z-scores were calculated for all numerical columns, but no outliers were detected (Z-scores were within the acceptable range).
Feature Scaling:

All numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler to standardize the data before feeding it into the model.
Model Building:
Two logistic regression models were trained on the dataset to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan.

First Model (No Class Weights):

Standard logistic regression was used without class weights.
Accuracy: 80.87%
Classification Report:
Precision: 0.84 for non-defaulters (class 0), 0.29 for defaulters (class 1).
Recall: 0.95 for class 0, 0.11 for class 1.
F1-score: 0.89 for class 0, 0.15 for class 1.
Confusion Matrix:
True positives (TP): 4 (defaulters correctly predicted).
True negatives (TN): 182 (non-defaulters correctly predicted).
False positives (FP): 10.
False negatives (FN): 34.
The first model performed well for class 0 (non-defaulters) but struggled to predict class 1 (defaulters), with a low recall for class 1.
Second Model (Class Weights Balanced):

Logistic regression was used with balanced class weights to give more importance to the minority class (defaulters).
Accuracy: 66.52%
Classification Report:
Precision: 0.91 for class 0, 0.29 for class 1.
Recall: 0.66 for class 0, 0.68 for class 1.
F1-score: 0.77 for class 0, 0.40 for class 1.
Confusion Matrix:
True positives (TP): 26.
True negatives (TN): 127.
False positives (FP): 65.
False negatives (FN): 12.
The second model performed better at identifying defaulters (class 1) compared to the first model, 
with a higher recall for class 1 (0.68). 
However, it had a higher false positive rate for class 0.
ROC Curve Analysis:
The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve was plotted to evaluate the performance of both models. The AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the models were:

First Model: AUC = 0.53 (near random performance, which is not ideal).
Second Model: AUC = 0.67 (better than the first model, showing that it is better at distinguishing between the two classes).
Model Comparison:
First Model:

Pros: High accuracy in predicting non-defaulters (class 0).
Cons: Poor at detecting defaulters (class 1), with a low recall and F1-score for class 1.
Suitable for scenarios where it is acceptable to miss some defaulters.
Second Model:

Pros: Improved recall for defaulters (class 1) due to the class weighting, 
making it more sensitive to detecting customers likely to default.
Cons: Lower overall accuracy due to an increase in false positives for non-defaulters (class 0).
Suitable for scenarios where identifying defaulters is a higher priority 
than classifying non-defaulters accurately (e.g., risk mitigation).
Conclusion:
The second model, which used class balancing, is better for identifying defaulters despite a decrease in overall accuracy. 
In credit risk analysis, identifying high-risk customers is more important than correctly classifying non-defaulters. Thus,
the second model would be preferred for practical use in loan risk assessment.
